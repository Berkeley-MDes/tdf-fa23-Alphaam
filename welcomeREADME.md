# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize them into folders. it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

These instructions were originally contained in the **README.md** for this repo. 
### FYI: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) ###
<h3> Note: GitHub Markdown supports <em>HTML formatting</em> too, if that helps! </h3>

Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions), which you can add directly to this file, like so:
---
# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

LINK TO EXAMPLE ENTRY WILL GO HERE

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- just keep this copy!
I hope you now feel empowered to make your GitHub Repository and README.md your own and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm ✨

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
