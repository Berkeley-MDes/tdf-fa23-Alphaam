### Assignment 1: Explore Grasshopper

## Progress

My exploration began with the realization that I, in fact, knew very little about Grasshopper. To remedy this, I turned to YouTube and ChatGPT to piece together the basics.

I followed the steps outlined in the class Wiki to experiment with the example file provided. However, I accidentally opened the wrong file, which led me on a quest to find and install new plugins to make the design visible. This detour introduced me to [this platform](https://www.food4rhino.com/en) where various Grasshopper plugins are available and taught me how to install them.

After finally locating the correct file, I began experimenting with the automated reporting feature that updates as you move objects in the design plane. This feature became my first set of constraints for the project.

Next, I started considering what my actual design would be. To guide this process, I listed the variables that would influence the design of a phone stand. These considerations are:

1. It must accommodate a pop socket.
2. It should be high enough to be safe from spills.
3. It should allow me to pick up my phone without touching the camera or sliding it, as this could scratch the phone.
4. It should be secure - no phone slip hazard

From these considerations, I concluded the following design requirements:
1. The stand must elevate the phone at least 2 cm off the ground.
2. It should have a minimal surface area to facilitate easy phone retrieval.
3. It should have an opening in the back that fits my pop socket which will act as a fastener.

To determine the 2 cm height minimum, I experimented with how I often spill liquids on my desk(which is where I intend to primarily use the stand) and performed measurements as shown below.

To learn how to achieve this, I have started watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzmZjo2_3-M0) and am experimenting with the techniques presented.

I also sketched a design that I think would work well.

## Reflections
I think I am steadily building more comfort with Grasshopper. The assignment is a very good exercise for familiarizing yourself with the basics of what the software can do. The YouTube tutorials make 3D printing, especially< seem less daunting and I am excited to print my design and to continue learning.
